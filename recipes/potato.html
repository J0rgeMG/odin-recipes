    <p>Description: Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, 
        but are really wonderful any time of the year! This is my mother's recipe,
        which is honestly the best potato latke I've had. I usually end up making 
        a second batch because they disappear so quickly. I've tried other recipes 
        and always return to this one. Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.</p>
