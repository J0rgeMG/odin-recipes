    <p>Description: These little goodies are the perfect addition 
        to your next holiday gathering or even the perfect 
        appetizer to serve before a cozy dinner at home. 
        Everyone will be dazzled by every delicious bite 
        (they won't be able to keep their hands off of them!) 
        You can smile while you think of how easy they were 
        to toss together! And the best part - I usually end up 
        with leftover stuffing, which freezes beautifully until 
        the next carry-in!</p>
